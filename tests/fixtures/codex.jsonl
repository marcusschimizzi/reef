This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\n\n.system/skill-installer\n  Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).\n\nfrontend-design\n  Use when the user asks to design, redesign, or visually style frontend components, pages, or views, including requests that change UI aesthetics, CSS, layout, typography, color, or motion.\n\nplanning-with-files/skills/planning-with-files\n  Implements Manus-style file-based planning for complex tasks. Creates task_plan.md, findings.md, and progress.md. Use when starting complex multi-step tasks, research projects, or any task requiring >5 tool calls. Now with automatic session recovery after /clear.\n\nsuperpowers:brainstorming\n  \"You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores user intent, requirements and design before implementation.\"\n\nsuperpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents\n  Use when facing 2+ independent tasks that can be worked on without shared state or sequential dependencies\n\nsuperpowers:executing-plans\n  Use when you have a written implementation plan to execute in a separate session with review checkpoints\n\nsuperpowers:finishing-a-development-branch\n  Use when implementation is complete, all tests pass, and you need to decide how to integrate the work - guides completion of development work by presenting structured options for merge, PR, or cleanup\n\nsuperpowers:receiving-code-review\n  Use when receiving code review feedback, before implementing suggestions, especially if feedback seems unclear or technically questionable - requires technical rigor and verification, not performative agreement or blind implementation\n\nsuperpowers:requesting-code-review\n  Use when completing tasks, implementing major features, or before merging to verify work meets requirements\n\nsuperpowers:subagent-driven-development\n  Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session\n\nsuperpowers:systematic-debugging\n  Use when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior, before proposing fixes\n\nsuperpowers:test-driven-development\n  Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code\n\nsuperpowers:using-git-worktrees\n  Use when starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace or before executing implementation plans - creates isolated git worktrees with smart directory selection and safety verification\n\nsuperpowers:using-superpowers\n  Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions\n\nsuperpowers:verification-before-completion\n  Use when about to claim work is complete, fixed, or passing, before committing or creating PRs - requires running verification commands and confirming output before making any success claims; evidence before assertions always\n\nsuperpowers:writing-plans\n  Use when you have a spec or requirements for a multi-step task, before touching code\n\nsuperpowers:writing-skills\n  Use when creating new skills, editing existing skills, or verifying skills work before deployment\n\nUsage:\n  superpowers-codex use-skill <skill-name>   # Load a specific skill\n\nSkill naming:\n  Superpowers skills: superpowers:skill-name (from ~/.codex/superpowers/skills/)\n  Personal skills: skill-name (from ~/.codex/skills/)\n  Personal skills override superpowers skills when names match.\n\nNote: All skills are disclosed at session start via bootstrap.\n\n---\n\n## Auto-loading superpowers:using-superpowers skill:\n\n# using-superpowers\n# Use when starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills, requiring Skill tool invocation before ANY response including clarifying questions\n# Skill-specific tools and reference files live in /home/marcuss/.codex/superpowers/skills/using-superpowers\n# ============================================\n\n<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\nIf you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.\n\nIF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE.

When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\n\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\n\n# Using Skills\n\n## The Rule\n\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check.
